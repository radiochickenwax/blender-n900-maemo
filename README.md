blender
=======

These are binaries for blender-2.4 armel that run on the maemo OS for nokia's n900 phone.  

dependencies
============

Everything is statically linked against python-2.5.4 so hopefully all you need is that, libgl1-mesa-swx11 and /bin/blender to get started.  The other libs are there if you need them.
